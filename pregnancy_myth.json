Exercise is not dangerous for your baby \u2013 there is some evidence that active women are less likely to experience problems in later pregnancy and labour. However, don't exhaust yourself. Remember that exercise doesn't have to be strenuous to be beneficial. You may need to slow down as your pregnancy progresses or if your maternity team advises you to. If in doubt, consult your maternity team."
